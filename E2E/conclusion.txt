I choose Option 1 - Demoblaze purchase flow scenario to automate.

It was quite challenging once there are some bugs into the application that make it hard to interact with the page elements and navigate through the page itself
Some of those challenges I faced required to add wait so the component could be properly loaded as for example:
- the forms that does not fill the name in case you just run the automation without this proper "pause"
- the purchase completion modal that does not close in case you just click it before proper loading time
